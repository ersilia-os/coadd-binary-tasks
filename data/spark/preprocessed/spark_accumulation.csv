To determine total cell antibiotic concentrations, treated cells were lysed with 50% acetonitrile. Antibiotic concentrations were analyzed by solid-phase extraction tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-MS/MS). To quantify the compound, the ng/mL value of compound obtained from a calibration curve was normalized to the OD600 value obtained for the specific test well and units were reported at ng/OD600.

To determine total cell antibiotic concentrations, treated cells were lysed with 50% acetonitrile. Antibiotic concentrations were analyzed by solid-phase extraction tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-MS/MS). To quantify the compound, the ng/mL value of compound obtained from a calibration curve was normalized to the OD600 value obtained for the specific test well and units were reported at ng/OD600. 

//

For calculations in SPARK, it was assumed authors meant ng/mL/OD600 and that 1 OD600 unit is 1E9 CFU/mL. The reported value was multiplied by 1000 to convert ng to pg then divided by the molecular weight of the compound (g/mol) to achieve nmol/1E12 CFU.",Curated Data,2.60E+03,1.75E+06,679.0,,,,Mean,Whole Cell / Total Cell,Control / Reference compound,64.0,95.3,15.0,37,Cell lysis with 50% acetonitrile,SPE-MS/MS,CAMHB,Escherichia coli,NR698,NB27172,No,Hyperpermeable,lptD4213 (imp4213),Hyperpermeable mutant (lptD4213) derived from NB27171 (CGSC 6152) from Natividad Ruiz (Princeton University).,Outer membrane permeable,,,,Widya 2019 ACS Infect.

To determine intracellular compound concentrations, cells treated with antibiotics were fractionated by osmotic shock to collect the periplasmic fraction and, separately, whole cell lysates, then further fractionated by sonication to collect the membrane and cytoplasm fractions. Fraction-associated antibiotic concentrations were calculated using standard curves and linear regression analysis.

//

Kinetic assays measuring intracellular concentration in whole cells were performed in filter plates. Cells treated with antibiotics were lysed with ice-cold methanol and ice-cold acetonitrile. Intracellular antibiotic concentrations were calculated using standard curves prepared in the same way.

To determine total cell antibiotic concentrations, treated cells were lysed with 50% acetonitrile. Antibiotic concentrations were analyzed by solid-phase extraction tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-MS/MS). To quantify the compound, the ng/mL value of compound obtained from a calibration curve was normalized to the OD600 value obtained for the specific test well and units were reported at ng/OD600.
